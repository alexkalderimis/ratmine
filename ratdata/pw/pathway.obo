name: insulin responsive facilitative sugar transporter mediated glucose transport pathway
def: "The GLUT family contains 14 members in mammals which can be grouped into 3 classes based on sequence similarities. The members of group I (best characterized) and of group III transporters facilitate glucose transport. Of the three members of group I, Slc2a4 (Glut4), is involved in insulin-mediated uptake of glucose in the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The response - central to glucose homeostasis - brings together several signaling and trafficking events." [PubMed:PMID\: 15466941; 15449578; 18171430; 17717074; 18570632 "Review articles"]

def: "The glycolytic pathway converts the six-carbon glucose to two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The ten reactions of glycolyssis can be subdivided into an energy consuming 'stage I' and an energy generating 'stage II'. The net energy yeld is two molecules of ATP. Pyruvate can further be oxidized via the citrate cycle, converted to lactose under anaerobic conditions or back to glucose via gluconeogenesis."

The functional versatility is confered through the diversity of regulatory subunits with which they interact. The holoenzyme dictates the role the protein complex plays in signaling pathways."
